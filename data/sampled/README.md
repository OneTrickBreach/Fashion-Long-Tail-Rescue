# PURPOSE: Memory-friendly subsets of the full dataset for local development
# and rapid iteration on a single PC.
#
# Generated by `src/data/sampler.py` using the sampling config in `config.yaml`.
#
# TYPICAL CONTENTS (git-ignored):
#   - transactions_sample.csv   → Stratified subset preserving long-tail distribution
#   - articles_sample.csv       → Filtered articles matching the sampled transactions
#   - customers_sample.csv      → Filtered customers matching the sampled transactions
#
# The default sample fraction is 5% (~1.5M transactions).
