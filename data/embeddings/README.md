# Pre-Computed Visual Embeddings Directory
#
# PURPOSE: Stores ResNet50 feature vectors extracted from product images.
# These are pre-computed once and reused during Hero model training to
# avoid loading images on-the-fly (critical for local PC memory constraints).
#
# Generated by `src/data/embeddings.py`.

# TYPICAL CONTENTS (git-ignored):
#   - article_embeddings.npy    → Shape: (num_articles, 2048) float32
#   - article_id_map.json       → Maps embedding row index → article_id
