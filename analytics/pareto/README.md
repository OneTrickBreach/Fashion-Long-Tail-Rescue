# Pareto Trade-off Study Directory
#
# PURPOSE: Contains artifacts for the multi-objective Pareto analysis
# that studies the trade-off between accuracy (nDCG@12, MRR) and
# diversity (Catalog Coverage).
#
# TYPICAL CONTENTS:
#   - pareto_frontier.png       → Scatter plot of Pareto-optimal configs
#   - pareto_data.csv           → Raw data for the Pareto analysis
#   - tradeoff_analysis.md      → Written discussion of trade-offs
#
# The Pareto study compares configurations of both the Villain and the
# Hero at various hyperparameter settings to visualize where the Hero
# dominates the Villain on multiple objectives simultaneously.
